# LazyRecipes - 1.15.1
Have you ever wanted to craft a ton of torches to mob-proof a forest but hated having to do a bunch of intermediate tedious steps to get there? Now you can be lazy and bulk-craft items without those pesky extra steps. 

*Note: This does not introduce any 'cheaty' recipes, simply removes the extra steps to craft.*
